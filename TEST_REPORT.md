**Status: ✅ PASSED**
- Service returns proper health status
- No authentication required
- Returns service metadata

### 2. Loan Application Processing

#### ✅ Valid Application - Approved
**Test Case:** High credit score (750), sufficient income, safe area
- **Input:** John Doe, Sunnyvale CA, 750 credit, $10,000 income, $150,000 loan, 24 months
- **Expected:** Approved
- **Result:** ✅ APPROVED - "Passed all checks" - Crime Grade: A

#### ✅ Credit Score Too Low - Denied (REQ-005)
**Test Case:** Credit score below 700 threshold
- **Input:** Jane Smith, 650 credit score
- **Expected:** Denied with specific reason
- **Result:** ✅ DENIED - "Credit score must be at least 700" - Crime Grade: D

#### ✅ Insufficient Income - Denied (REQ-005)
**Test Case:** Monthly income insufficient for loan amount
- **Input:** Bob Johnson, $2,000 income, $200,000 loan, 120 months
- **Calculation:** Required: (200000/120) * 1.5 = $2,500 > $2,000 ❌
- **Result:** ✅ DENIED - "Insufficient monthly income for requested loan amount"

#### ✅ Crime Grade F - Denied (REQ-007)
**Test Case:** Property in high-crime area
- **Input:** Alice Brown, East Palo Alto CA (known high-crime area)
- **Expected:** Denied due to crime grade F
- **Result:** ✅ DENIED - "Property location has unacceptable crime grade (F)" - Crime Grade: F

### 3. Input Validation (REQ-013)

#### ✅ Missing Required Fields
**Test Case:** Empty/invalid required fields
- **Input:** Missing applicant name, invalid credit score, negative income
- **Result:** ✅ 400 Bad Request with detailed validation errors

#### ✅ Out of Range Values
**Test Case:** Values outside acceptable ranges
- **Input:** Credit score 900 (>850), loan term 500 months (>480)
- **Result:** ✅ 400 Bad Request with range validation errors

### 4. Authentication Security (REQ-011)

#### ✅ No API Key
**Test Case:** Request without x-api-key header
- **Result:** ✅ 401 Unauthorized - "API key is required"

#### ✅ Invalid API Key
**Test Case:** Request with wrong API key
- **Result:** ✅ 401 Unauthorized - "Invalid API key provided"

#### ✅ Valid API Key
**Test Case:** Request with correct API key
- **Result:** ✅ 201 Created - Request processed successfully

### 5. Loan Retrieval (REQ-004)

#### ✅ Successful Retrieval
**Test Case:** GET /loan/:id with valid ID
- **Process:** Create loan → Retrieve by ID → Verify data matches
- **Result:** ✅ All data matches original submission

#### ✅ Non-existent Loan
**Test Case:** GET /loan/non-existent-id
- **Result:** ✅ 404 Not Found - "Loan application not found"

### 6. Error Handling

#### ✅ Malformed JSON
**Test Case:** Invalid JSON in request body
- **Input:** `{ invalid json }`
- **Result:** ✅ 400 Bad Request - "Invalid JSON format in request body"
